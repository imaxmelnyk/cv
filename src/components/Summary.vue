        As a software engineer with 8 years of experience, I specialize in designing and building scalable,
        fault-tolerant backend systems and distributed architectures that can handle large volumes of traffic and data.
        I have a strong foundation in functional programming principles and
        am well-versed in working with a variety of programming languages and technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the course of my career, I have gained experience working with startups as well as large corporations,
        which has given me a flexible and adaptable approach to problem-solving.
